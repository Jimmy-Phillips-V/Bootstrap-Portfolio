                    <p>
                        It all started back in Los Angeles, January 19th, 1994. 
                        I was born into a long line of Jimmy's, the fifth to be exact, set out to ruffle the world.
                        I spent my formiddable years growing up in Pasadena, California until I went off to University of the Pacific in beautiful Stockton, California.
                        At school I studied International Relations with minors in French and Anthropology, which is just a fancy way to say I wanted no job prospects after graduating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from University I decided to try my luck working in immigration law back in Los Angeles, which at first seemed fruitful and lead me to believe I should go to law school.
                        After working for another year and a half at law firms in San Francisco and getting to know a lot of attorneys, law no longer seemed like a smart career move.
                        I knew I wanted to do something that would enable me to problem solve and be a part of a work community and culture that thrives on innovation and collaboration.
                        So as of now, I consider myself saved from the legal community and career path.
